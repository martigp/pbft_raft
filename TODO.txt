Client de-deuplication, probably some in memory store of most recent client req
id seen (seen_request, proposed, locked, commited for each).

Making sure clients get responses from everyone
    - changing client and server commited
    - client RPC for reception of executed commands, on-demmand server->client
    connection establishment

Timeout & Leader Change
    - Leader changes on every node, (viewNumber >= vHeight). viewNumber is
    incremented every time is vHeight is incremented and every time a Timeout
    happens (leader change)
    - timeouts on client:
        some time passes before they get N-F identical responses, rebroadcast
    -on server:
        upon receipt of client request, start a timer, timer is cancelled when
        receive corresponding proposal.
    - leader changes only instigated by a client
@Onkar

Client signature on messages (should be fairly straightforward)

Catch up when you've fallen behind (maybe just another RPC).
TODO after others done, related to timeout and leader change to perhaps
